Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project is an application that will make going to the DMV easier and less stressful while conducting your driver’s test. 
Customers can take their online test, see their scores and make appointments with the local DMV to take the road test without waiting in line for you to be called.
This would help with the mass tests that customers fail on a daily. 
Our client in this project is Liam (the owner) and Ian (the IT officer). 
The system that they are needing us to design is scalable manageable and very accessible to all users.

What did you do particularly well?

I believe that I did well on the Business Document because I listed everything that was required for this project. 
My document was very detailed and pointed out areas that could have been easily overlooked.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would improve my charts and the system design document. The drafts were not easy to understand.
I think pulling then together a little more would be very helpful to the reviewer.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user’s needs by taking the information from the interview and implementing it into the system diagrams. 
When we consider a project like this the first thing, 
we think about is the user. The entire system is about creating something that fits the users needs. 
The user is the main thought process behind the system.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I would first get all the information that is needed to design the system, then I would implement it into a UML diagram to see what the process would look like.
I would make sure that everything is in order and easy to read for the client.
